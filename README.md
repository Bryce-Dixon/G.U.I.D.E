# G.U.I.D.E - Godot Unified Input Detection Engine

G.U.I.D.E is an extension for the Godot Engine that allows you to easily use input from multiple sources, such as keyboard, mouse, gamepad, etc. in a unified way. Gone are the days where mouse input was handled differently from joysticks. No matter where the input comes from - your game code stays the same.

## Features

- Unified input detection from multiple sources (keyboard, mouse, gamepad, etc.).
- Inputs can be mapped to game specific actions.
- Inputs from different sources can be combined (e.g. build a 2D axis from 4 buttons or 2 gamepad triggers).
- Inputs can be modified (e.g. for joystick dead-zones, sensitivity, inversion, etc.).
- Built-in support for common action patterns (e.g. tap, hold, press, release, etc.).
- Built-in support for local multiplayer (e.g. multiple players with different input sources).
- Built-in remapping system (e.g. change input mappings at runtime).
- Integrates with Godot's built-in input system (so if you always wanted to navigate your UI with your joystick you can do so now).
