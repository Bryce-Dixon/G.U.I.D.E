# To Do

This lists the currently open to do items in no particular order.

## Open
- [ ] Prevent having the same action twice in a context as the second one would be filtered out anyways.
- [ ] Add a C# API.
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Prepare for asset library (git attributes, page, etc.)
- [ ] Remove get_action_value_xxx from Action (replaced by value_xxx property)


## Done
- [x] Add icon/text renderers for PS/XBOX/Nintendo controllers
- [x] Make the fallback icons less ugly.
- [x] Add functionality for runtime re-binding.
- [x] Fix icon/text for Any input
- [x] Fix remapping of WASD to ESDF
- [x] Implement input consumption and action prioritization.
- [x] Fix "incomplete format" error popping up when rendering an input icon.
- [x] Implement elapsed/triggered time.
- [x] Make an editor for setting up the system. The inspector is atrocious.
- [x] Decide whether to convert into C++ after the prototyping phase is done (decided against it, GDScript is fast enough, easier to maintain and works on all platforms out of the box).
