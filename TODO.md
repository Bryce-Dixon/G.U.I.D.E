# To Do

This lists the currently open to do items in no particular order.

## Open
- [ ] Prevent having the same action twice in a context as the second one would be filtered
	  out anyways.
- [ ] Fix icon/text for Any input
- [ ] Add icon/text renderers for PS/XBOX/Nintendo controllers
- [ ] Make the fallback icons less ugly.
- [ ] Simplify the icon renderer infrastructure, maybe it's just easier to serve static icons.
- [ ] Add functionality for runtime re-binding.
- [ ] Add a C# API (https://github.com/DmitriySalnikov/godot_debug_draw_3d/issues/2#issuecomment-1406989099).
- [ ] Decide whether to convert into C++ after the prototyping phase is done
- [ ] Documentation


## Done
- [x] Fix remapping of WASD to ESDF
- [x] Implement input consumption and action prioritization.
- [x] Fix "incomplete format" error popping up when rendering an input icon.
- [x] Implement elapsed/triggered time.
- [x] Make an editor for setting up the system. The inspector is atrocious.
